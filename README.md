Ansible roles
=============

Common role collection for web application


How to use
----------

### 1. Get as submodule

```sh
$ git submodule add git@github.com:creasty/ansible-roles.git common
```

If you prefer use local clone, symbolic link will do.

```sh
$ ln -s ~/somewhere/the/repository/exists common
```
